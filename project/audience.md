# For whom?

The LOAMA project is created for users with a technological knowledge, but we've focused on several factors while designing the application:
- **Ease of use**: LOAMA was designed with ease of use in mind by reducing & simplifying the steps that need to be taken to assign permissions. 
- **Accessibiliy**: In order to make LOAMA as accessible as possible, we omitted using technical terms to describe function. Instead, by using a combination of icons, simple sentences and colors, we indicate the status of files and divert attention of the user.

## Persona

In order to have a representation of our user, we decided to create a persona in order to more understand our user:
