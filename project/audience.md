# For whom?

The LOAMA project is created for users with a technological background, but we've focused on several factors while designing the application:
- **Ease of use**: LOAMA was designed with ease of use in mind by reducing & simplifying the steps that need to be taken to assign permissions. 
- **Accessibiliy**: To make LOAMA as accessible as possible, we omitted using technical terms to describe functions. Instead, by using a combination of icons, simple sentences and colours, we indicate the status of files and divert the attention of the user.

By using the information gained during the [brand creation](/project/brand.md), we made a persona to guide us during the design process of [Loama](/deliverables/loama/index.md):

### Pains & Problems
> What are the problems the user encounters?
#### LOAMA
- I can't see what permissions are configured for the files in my pod
- I don't see who can access my files and which permissions they have
- What do the permissions actually mean within my Solid Pod?
- Why should I use Solid over other technologies or just letting a company have my data?

#### Solid-enabled apps
- What effects do the permissions have that the application is requesting?
- How do I specify which data an application may use?

### Needs
> What does the users want to do within the app?
#### LOAMA
- I want to see what data a person, company or application can access
- I want to see when my data was accessed
- I want to revoke or allow acess to my data
- I want to understand what the permissions mean and the effect of allowing them

#### Solid-enabled apps
- I want to use my data in my Solid pod across different platforms
- I want to sign on using my Solid pod and allow the application to use my data

### Motivation
> Why does a user wants the things he wants?

- I want to be in control of my own data
- I want to share the same data across platforms
- I want to easily revoke access to sensitive information
- I want to manage my permissions in a centralized application, not across different platforms
