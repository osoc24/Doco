|**Control**||The permission to manage access to a resource, including setting permissions for other users.|

## D

|Term|Abbriviation|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Data Pod**||Personal online datastore where users store their data in a Solid ecosystem. Each pod is controlled by the individual it belongs to and is hosted by a certain provider.|

|**Index Page**||A resource in a Solid pod that provides an entry point for navigating other resources within the pod.|
|**Internationalized Resource Identifier**|IRI|Similar to a URI, but it allows a wider range of characters, including those from non-Latin scripts, making it more globally accessible. *(`https://例子.测试/资源|`)*|
|**Interoperability**||The ability of different systems and organizations to work together (inter-operate) by using standardized data formats and protocols.|

## M

|Term|Abbriviation|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Matcher**||A component or process that selects resources or data based on specified criteria.|

## O

|Term|Abbriviation|Description|

|**Origin**||The source domain or URL from which a request is made.|
|**Owner**||The individual or entity that has control over a resource or Solid pod.|

## P

|Term|Abbriviation|Description|

|**Read**||The permission to view a resource.|
|**Resource**||Any item (file, document, data) stored in a Solid pod, which can be accessed or manipulated through Solid protocols.|
|**Rule**||A statement that defines conditions and constraints for actions and permissions.|

## S

|Term|Abbriviation|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Social Linked Data**|SOLID|A web decentralization project, aiming to give users control over their personal data by storing it in decentralized pods.|

|**Solid Server**||A server that hosts Solid pods and provides interfaces for accessing and managing the data within them.|
|**SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language**|SPARQL|A query language for databases, able to retrieve and manipulate data stored in RDF format.|
|**Storage**||The location or space where data in a Solid pod is kept.|

## T
