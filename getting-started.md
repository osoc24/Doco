# Welcome to LOAMA handover page!

> **L**inked **O**pen **A**cces **M**anagement **A**pp

This website is meant for documenting the LOAMA project, the different dependencies and additional notes for future development.

## Goals

The LOAMA project was born out of 3 goals:
1. **Allow people to manage SOLID permissions**: Solid pods allow for you to retain your data, but managing who can access that data hasn't been easy. LOAMA wants to make this easier by providing **an user-friendly way to manage those permissions.**
2. **Envision a privacy-focused way to request permission**: Applications can use Solid pods, which allows user to bring and manage their own data, but how would an application request those permissions in a clear and privacy-first way?
3. **Make Solid and it's benefits more clear**: The solid allows for control of your data that is unknown on the internet today, but that control also bring a lot of complexity for users. Loama tries to make this more understandable, by providing a revised [Lexicon](/project/lexicon) and creating an interface that is focused on ease of use.

## Research

In order to understand our users and how they would interact with our project, we spend time defining our target audience and creating a fitting theme by taking inspiration of the [Solid Project](https://solidproject.org)

## Deliverables

Thanks to research, we gained a steady foundation to create our application. These applications were created and developed with feedback from [Imec]() and [IDLab](). Out of the feedback from them and the entire OSOC team, we designed and developed the following applications:
- [Loama :arrow_right:](/loama/index.md)
- [Mockbook :arrow_right:](/toco/mockbook/index.md)
- [DoctorApp :arrow_right:](/toco/doctorapp/index.md) 

## Future Prospects

Unfortunaly, we had only 4 weeks projects for this project *(and we wished we had more time)*. In order to help future developent for LOAMA, we provide a overview of the current [limitations](/project/lexicon.md) and [future considerations](/loama/feedback.md) for the project

## Brought by IMEC & IDLab

This project was made possible by [Imec](https://www.imec-int.com/) and [IDLab](https://www.ugent.be/ea/idlab/en):

- Imec is the world's leading independent nanoelectronics R&D hub. The combination of their talent, infrastructure, and partner network enables breakthroughs towards microchips that are smaller, faster, more affordable, and more sustainable.

- IDLab is a collaboration between [UGent](https://www.ugent.be/) and [Imec](https://www.imec-int.com/) and performs research on a wide range of topics, such as AI, IoT, Networking, Circuit design and more.

::: tip :rocket: Powered by OSOC

This project was created during OSOC 2024, a yearly event where students are giving the opportunity to create a proof-of-concept for a cooperation. OSOC allows students to:
- Work on real projects and showcase their work
- Learn from industry experts thanks to several presentation, etc...
- Hone their skills and work within a group composed of different technological profiles, like developers, designers, innovation, etc...
